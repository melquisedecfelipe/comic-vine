Disaster struck one day, years later, when Frank and his family went for a picnic in Central Park only to witness a mob execution on a high profile member of the mafia. The mob fired on his family, killing them all before his eyes and thus destroying everything he had lived for.</p><p>Unable to move on and failed by a corrupt criminal justice system, Frank Castle sought revenge, prompting him to "disappear" just as he was to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. As he resurfaced, he was the vigilante now known as the Punisher, wearing Kevlar body armor with a large skull imprinted on his chest and armed with a variety of weapons. Frank not only vowed to have revenge for his family, but also dedicated the rest of his life to fighting crime.</p><h2>Creation</h2><figure data-align="right" data-size="small" data-ref-id="1300-2806792" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117480/2806792-weinspidey12.jpg" data-ratio="1.4833333333333" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 600px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:148.3%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/117480/2806792-weinspidey12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2806792"><img alt="Punisher saving the day." src="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117480/2806792-weinspidey12.jpg" srcset="https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/117480/2806792-weinspidey12.jpg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/117480/2806792-weinspidey12.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/117480/2806792-weinspidey12.jpg 431w" sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px" data-width="431"></a><figcaption>Punisher saving the day.</figcaption></figure><p>Frank Castle debuted in 1974\'s <a href="/the-amazing-spider-man-the-punisher-strikes-twice/4000-105443/" data-ref-id="4000-105443"> The Amazing Spider-Man #129</a> as the vigilante assassin hired by <a href="/jackal/4005-10974/" data-ref-id="4005-10974"> Jackal</a> to kill <a href="/spider-man/4005-1443/" data-ref-id="4005-1443"> Spider-Man</a> for the apparent murder of <a href="/norman-osborn/4005-58812/" data-ref-id="4005-58812"> Norman Osborn</a>. As differences between Punisher and Jackal came to a head, Punisher realized that he was being tricked into killing Spider-Man and that our friendly neighborhood web-slinger was not in fact a criminal or murderer. From then on, audiences came to understand Punisher\'s origin and that he was not a villain and he then returned to aid Spider-Man when old war buddy turned insane war criminal Hitman was hired to kill the web head.
