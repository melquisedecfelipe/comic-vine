    deck: 'A long-lived mutant with the rage of a beast and the soul of a Samurai, James "Logan" Howlett\'s once mysterious past is filled with blood, war, and betrayal. Possessing an accelerated healing factor, keenly enhanced senses, and bone claws in each hand (along with his skeleton) that are coated in adamantium; Wolverine is, without question, the ultimate weapon.',
    description: `<p>The man who would be known as the superhero named Wolverine was born as James Howlett in the mid 1880s in Alberta, <a href="../../canada/34-55868/" rel="nofollow ">Canada</a>. He was the second and sickly child to <a href="../../elizabeth-howlett/29-44325/" rel="nofollow ">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="../../howlett-senior/29-44326/" rel="nofollow ">John Howlett Sr.</a> His mother was ill and, in the early 1900s, a young Irish girl named <a href="../../rose/29-44342/" rel="nofollow ">Rose O'Hara</a> was brought to the Howlett estate to be a friend and a caretaker to young James. Together they befriended a young boy named <a href="../../dog-logan/29-44327/" rel="nofollow ">Dog</a>, son of the grounds keeper, <a href="../../thomas-logan/29-44323/" rel="nofollow ">Thomas Logan</a>. Dog tried to form a normal bond between the two, but due to his father’s resentment and drunken abuse, he grew to resent his station in life; so much so that one day he makes undue advances on Rose, which are reported by young James to his father. This whole chain of events leads to <a href="../../thomas-logan/29-44323/" rel="nofollow ">Thomas Logan</a> being sacked from his position as groundskeeper, following which he goes seeking for <a href="/elizabeth-howlett/4005-44325/" data-ref-id="4005-44325">Elizabeth Howlett</a>, trying to convince her to leave with him. This leads to an altercation that results in the death of <a href="/john-howlett/4005-4657/" data-ref-id="4005-4657">John Howlett</a>. The shock of seeing his father murdered in front of him leads to the manifestation of young James’ powers and he stabs <a href="/thomas-logan/4005-44323/" data-ref-id="4005-44323">Thomas </a>with his newly drawn claws, also slashing Dog across the face before fainting. He and Rose flee the house and make their way through the harsh Canadian wilderness with James near-catatonic and Rose having to facilitate their transportation, while <a href="/dog-logan/4005-44327/" data-ref-id="4005-44327">Dog</a> tells the police that Rose was the killer.</p>`,
